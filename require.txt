I need a file system implementation on python that recreate the following commands using node to recreate an i-node:

- ls
- ls -i
- ls -R
- rm <name>
- mv <old_name> <new_name>
- mkdir <name>
- touch <name>
- cd <path> (path can be "..", this will return you 1 down or "" that will return you to the root)
- exit
- pwd
